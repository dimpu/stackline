### Setup
```
yarn
yarn start
```
to run the project locally.

### Changes to existing mocks.

I centered 'Retail Store' text and tags as centered elements so that it looks good on both Desktop and Mobile.

### Features
1. Responsive design. 
2. Responsive Chart with dynamic rendering.
3. Responsive Table.
4. Chart Overlay for data points.
5. Sortable table columns.
6. Paginated Table. 
7. I18n Support. 

### TODO

1. Add Unit tests.
2. Migrated to GraphQL(This will remove lot of redux boiler and state management will be a lot easier to deal with )
